# ‚ö° Energy Usage & Savings Project

üìå **Tools Used**: R, Python, Shiny, ggplot2, caret, Random Forest, SVM, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)  
üìÅ **Dataset**: eSC Energy Usage Data (Building Characteristics, Energy Consumption, Weather Data)  
üìà **Goal**: Predict energy usage patterns and propose strategies to reduce peak energy demand, particularly during the summer months.

## üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting **energy consumption patterns** to help optimize energy usage and reduce peak energy demand. We used multiple **predictive modeling techniques** and an **interactive Shiny app** to explore how different factors impact energy consumption, especially during the peak month of **July**.

We performed the following tasks:

- **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values, negative entries, and other data issues.
- **Data Transformation**: Aggregated energy consumption data for household categories (e.g., kitchen, laundry, HVAC).
- **Feature Engineering**: Used **weather data**, **building characteristics**, and **energy consumption** for prediction models.
- **Model Training**: Applied **Multiple Linear Regression**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Random Forest (RF)** models to predict energy consumption for July.
- **Model Performance Comparison**: Evaluated models using performance metrics such as **R-squared**, **RMSE**, and **MSE**.

## üß† Key Features Engineered

- **Building Characteristics**: Data on building size, insulation, and climate zone.
- **Energy Consumption Categories**: Aggregated consumption for kitchen, heating, cooling, water heating, and appliances.
- **Weather Data**: Temperature, humidity, and other factors affecting energy demand.
- **Monthly Aggregation**: Energy consumption aggregated by month for seasonal trends.

## ü§ñ Models Evaluated

| Model                         | Accuracy | R-squared | Notes                                                       |
|-------------------------------|----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multiple Linear Regression** | 89.4%    | 0.89      | Best performance for forecasting overall energy usage       |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | 82.3%    | 0.85      | Handles non-linear relationships effectively                 |
| **Random Forest**              | 85.6%    | 0.87      | Good for complex datasets but not as accurate as MLR         |

## üìä Results Summary

- **Best Model**: The **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)** model explained **89.4%** of the variability in energy consumption, making it the most accurate for this application.
- **SVM & Random Forest**: Both models performed well, but MLR was preferred due to its simplicity and better prediction accuracy.
- **Shiny App**: The Shiny app allows users to explore how various factors (e.g., temperature, building size) affect energy usage and visualize the impact of these variables over time.

## üìå Key Takeaways

- **Predictive Modeling**: **MLR** was the best model for forecasting energy consumption, but **SVM** and **Random Forest** also provided useful insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Aggregating energy usage data by categories (kitchen, laundry, etc.) and incorporating weather data improved model accuracy.
- **Shiny App**: Interactive dashboards provided stakeholders (e.g., CEOs) with insights into how changes in building features and weather conditions affect energy consumption.
- **Energy Management**: The project highlights the importance of understanding **seasonal** and **daily** energy usage patterns to manage energy demand effectively, especially during peak times like **July**.
